Task Management Application Documentation and Guideline
=======================================================

In this application I have used reactjs for frontend and nodejs in backend.

To hand shake between frontend and backend I have used axios library.

To perform routing I have used react-router-dom library.

To perform backend communication I have used express and cors module.

To Design interact web page I have used bootstrap library.

		title varchar(15),
